# Hiring-Process-Analytics
While working in this project, I have conducted Hiring Process Analytics for a multinational company, focusing on data-driven insights. Using Excel, and various statistical concepts I handled missing data, grouped categories, detected and managed outliers, and summarized findings through statistics and visualizations. Key tasks included analyzing gender distribution in hires, calculating average salary, creating salary distribution intervals, visualizing department proportions, and representing position tiers within the organization. This data-driven approach aims to enhance the company's hiring process and decision-making.
